# HOW TO CREATE THIS FILE:
# 1. Install a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" 
#    (Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/)
# 2. Log into YouTube with a THROWAWAY account (not your main account!)
# 3. Export cookies and save as cookies.txt in this folder
# 4. NEVER commit this file to git (it's in .gitignore)
